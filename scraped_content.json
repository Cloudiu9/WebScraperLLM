        "content": "President of Russia Vladimir Putin:Mr Khusnullin, you wanted to tell me\nabout several new projects. Please, proceed.\n\nDeputy Prime MinisterMarat KhusnullinKhusnullin MaratDeputy Prime Minister of the Government of the Russian Federation:Mr President, we have finished\nshaping the Infrastructure for Life project, which includes the Housing and Comfortable Urban Environment and Safe and High-Quality Roads. This year, we\nwill complete these two national projects, which have proved effective over the past six years.\n\nWe have reached the planned targets in terms of housing as well as road\nconstruction. The project will end within several months, but we can already say\nthat it has been fulfilled.\n\nDuring the implementation of this project, our construction industry has\ngrown by 35 percent. Growth was reported every year, regardless of the pandemic\nor anything else. This is thanks to the systemic decision and additional\nfunding. We have done a great deal in terms of legislation, which explains the project’s success.\n\nThe new project, Infrastructure for Life, incorporated all the best\nelements of the previous projects plus new approaches. The latter include a comprehensive approach to the development of residential areas, about which you\nspoke on many occasions. We have identified growth points, starting from rural\nreference points up to large agglomerations.\n\nWe have analysed the programme for the further development of housing\nand concluded that we will continue to build at least 100 million square metres\nof housing every year until 2030. In other words, new housing will constitute\none fifth of the total by 2030, with 33 metres of housing per capita.\n\nOur mortgage programme did well in the past years. For example, the number of new projects has grown by 15 percent year on year despite everything.\n\nWe are actively working on the urban development potential together with\ngovernors, that is, construction documents. We estimate our construction\npotential at around 500 million square metres. We hope to increase it to one billion\nsquare metres.\n\nAs you instructed,\nwe are working on a modernisation programme for communal infrastructure. The programme\nis shaped by now, with different sources of funding, such as direct budgetary\nfunding, loans, corporate funding, and investment. We believe we will be able to stop the depreciation of the infrastructure and to improve it substantially\nwithin the next five to six years. Moreover, it will not be a deterring factor for the development of residential areas because for some towns, we already have\nenergy and communal infrastructure restrictions. We believe that it will help us\nachieve the goal as consistently as we did with roads.\n\nWe continue working on developing road infrastructure. We have a plan. You can look on the map, Mr President. It shows all the main…\n\nVladimir Putin:Support\nnetworks.\n\nMarat Khusnullin:Yes.\nThe map shows all of our international corridors which,\nby the way,\nserve 140 million of the Russian population. So, the key\npurpose of the main roads we have – the roads we call international – is to connect\nthe cities, towns and regions in Russia. We have a schedule of works until 2030;\nthey include 50 detour roads bypassing cities, something that is now highly in demand,\nas well as border access roads, and bringing roads up to regulatory standards.\nSo, there is a general plan, and we have balanced out the money. The work is in progress.\n\nAn important matter you always pay attention to is road traffic safety. The number of car accidents goes down every year,\nalong with the number of associated deaths and injuries.\nThis is the result of our systemwide work with the Interior Ministry.\n\nWe have work on repayable financing set up well. It is a project that we started with the Finance Ministry and regional officials as per your instruction.\nWe have investment budgetary loans, bonds and special treasury loans.\nAll these tools make something we call an Infrastructure Menu.\n\nWe have reported to you multiple times.\nThank you for extending this programme through 2030. Now every governor understands\nwhat they will be able to do in the next few years. And these funds are repayable. As a helpful\nmeasure, you have granted them the right to restructure, meaning they can use the funding, pay it back and then they can invest again, which is a great\nadvantage.\n\nConsidering all the tasks you set, we believe that we are ready to affirm\nthe project and achieve the set goals.\n\nThank you.\n\nVladimir Putin:Let’s\ndiscuss it in more detail.\n\n<…>\n\nPublished in sections:News,Transcripts\n\nPublication date:October 31, 2024, 14:00\n\nDirect link:en.kremlin.ru/d/75459\n\nText version"
