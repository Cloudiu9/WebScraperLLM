        "content": "President of Russia Vladimir Putin:Mr Khusnullin, you wanted to tell me\nabout several new projects. Please, proceed.\n\nDeputy Prime MinisterMarat KhusnullinKhusnullin MaratDeputy Prime Minister of the Government of the Russian Federation:Mr President, we have finished\nshaping the Infrastructure for Life project, which includes the Housing and Comfortable Urban Environment and Safe and High-Quality Roads. This year, we\nwill complete these two national projects, which have proved effective over the past six years.\n\nWe have reached the planned targets in terms of housing as well as road\nconstruction. The project will end within several months, but we can already say\nthat it has been fulfilled.\n\nDuring the implementation of this project, our construction industry has\ngrown by 35 percent. Growth was reported every year, regardless of the pandemic\nor anything else. This is thanks to the systemic decision and additional\nfunding. We have done a great deal in terms of legislation, which explains the project’s success.\n\nThe new project, Infrastructure for Life, incorporated all the best\nelements of the previous projects plus new approaches. The latter include a comprehensive approach to the development of residential areas, about which you\nspoke on many occasions. We have identified growth points, starting from rural\nreference points up to large agglomerations.\n\nWe have analysed the programme for the further development of housing\nand concluded that we will continue to build at least 100 million square metres\nof housing every year until 2030. In other words, new housing will constitute\none fifth of the total by 2030, with 33 metres of housing per capita.\n\nOur mortgage programme did well in the past years. For example, the number of new projects has grown by 15 percent year on year despite everything.\n\nWe are actively working on the urban development potential together with\ngovernors, that is, construction documents. We estimate our construction\npotential at around 500 million square metres. We hope to increase it to one billion\nsquare metres.\n\nAs you instructed,\nwe are working on a modernisation programme for communal infrastructure. The programme\nis shaped by now, with different sources of funding, such as direct budgetary\nfunding, loans, corporate funding, and investment. We believe we will be able to stop the depreciation of the infrastructure and to improve it substantially\nwithin the next five to six years. Moreover, it will not be a deterring factor for the development of residential areas because for some towns, we already have\nenergy and communal infrastructure restrictions. We believe that it will help us\nachieve the goal as consistently as we did with roads.\n\nWe continue working on developing road infrastructure. We have a plan. You can look on the map, Mr President. It shows all the main…\n\nVladimir Putin:Support\nnetworks.\n\nMarat Khusnullin:Yes.\nThe map shows all of our international corridors which,\nby the way,\nserve 140 million of the Russian population. So, the key\npurpose of the main roads we have – the roads we call international – is to connect\nthe cities, towns and regions in Russia. We have a schedule of works until 2030;\nthey include 50 detour roads bypassing cities, something that is now highly in demand,\nas well as border access roads, and bringing roads up to regulatory standards.\nSo, there is a general plan, and we have balanced out the money. The work is in progress.\n\nAn important matter you always pay attention to is road traffic safety. The number of car accidents goes down every year,\nalong with the number of associated deaths and injuries.\nThis is the result of our systemwide work with the Interior Ministry.\n\nWe have work on repayable financing set up well. It is a project that we started with the Finance Ministry and regional officials as per your instruction.\nWe have investment budgetary loans, bonds and special treasury loans.\nAll these tools make something we call an Infrastructure Menu.\n\nWe have reported to you multiple times.\nThank you for extending this programme through 2030. Now every governor understands\nwhat they will be able to do in the next few years. And these funds are repayable. As a helpful\nmeasure, you have granted them the right to restructure, meaning they can use the funding, pay it back and then they can invest again, which is a great\nadvantage.\n\nConsidering all the tasks you set, we believe that we are ready to affirm\nthe project and achieve the set goals.\n\nThank you.\n\nVladimir Putin:Let’s\ndiscuss it in more detail.\n\n<…>\n\nPublished in sections:News,Transcripts\n\nPublication date:October 31, 2024, 14:00\n\nDirect link:en.kremlin.ru/d/75459\n\nText version"

        "title": "Meeting with Government members",
        "summary": "The President held a meeting, via videoconference, with Government members.",
        "content": "President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Good afternoon, colleagues.\n\nToday, we will hear what Oksana Lut has\nto share with us about the comprehensive development of rural areas to 2030.\n\nBut first, we will discuss several urgent\nissues. Gazprom’s gas infrastructure development programme is underway, but\nthere are some more related matters which we need to discuss concerning\ndomestically manufactured heating equipment.\n\nMr Tsivilev, could you please say a few words about that. How things stand in gas infrastructure development and in general?\n\nMinister of EnergySergei TsivilevTsivilev SergeiMinister of Energy of the Russian Federation: Mr President, colleagues.\n\nThe social programme for installing\nsolid fuel boilers for the households in the Siberian and Far Eastern federal districts\nis being drafted in accordance with your instruction and the outcomes of the Federal Assembly Address. The point of this programme is to provide our people\nwith efficient, environmentally friendly, and safe coal-fired heating\nequipment. I am talking about domestically manufactured high efficiency – over\n84 percent – solid fuel boilers with automatic fuel feeding.\n\n(The Minister went on to explain that replacing boilers will significantly\nimprove the quality of life. Fuel consumption is cut by 30 to 50 percent, coal\nloading can be done once every few days, and the automation system maintains a consistent temperature in the room. Safety is enhanced because, unlike a furnace,\nthe boiler is installed in a separate enclosure in an apartment building, or in a shed next to an apartment building. Furthermore, modern boilers are much more\nenvironmentally friendly. He also noted that, in accordance with the Presidential\ninstruction, the social gas infrastructure development programme has been\nsuccessfully implemented since 2020, but it becomes economically unviable in case of a community that is far from the main gas pipeline. In such places,\ninstalling solid fuel boilers is a practical solution to address social issues.\nThe programme will primarily benefit entitled groups, such as World War II\nveterans, participants in the special military operation and their families,\nlarge families, and people with disabilities who will have the equipment\nsupplied and installed at no charge.)\n\nWe are drafting this programme in cooperation with the Ministry of Construction and other federal agencies and regional authorities. The Lugansk and Donetsk people’s republics showed\ninterest in this programme when it was discussed with regional representatives.\nWe are considering bringing Rostec State Corporation into this programme.\n\nWe will prepare the package of draft\ndocuments by the end of the year, and will begin installing boilers in 2025.\n\nI would like to thank you for supporting this initiative. At least 32 billion rubles have been set aside for this programme by your decision.\n\nThank you for your attention.\n\nVladimir\nPutin: Thank you.\n\nYou\nmentioned that there are individuals who have the right to receive this\nequipment free of charge. It is often the case that people are unaware of what\nthey are entitled to, and who qualifies for certain benefits.\n\nMr Chuychenko, I am aware that you are organising pro\nbono legal assistance for the public. How is this work progressing?\n\nMinister\nof JusticeKonstantin ChuychenkoChuychenko KonstantinMinister of Justice of the Russian Federation: Mr President, colleagues,\n\nIn May\n2021, we submitted a report to you, Mr President, regarding the status of pro\nbono legal aid within the Russian Federation. Let me provide a concise update\non the progress made and the challenges that remain outstanding.\n\nOur efforts\nhave been concentrated in three principal domains: enhancement of legal\nregulation, development of an organisational framework, primarily through the establishment of public law offices, and advancement of informatisation and digital transformation.\n\nWith\nrespect to regulatory enhancements, seven federal laws have been enacted based\non our recommendations, aimed at broadening the categories of citizens eligible\nfor pro bono legal assistance. This expansion primarily includes servicemen and families of special military operation participants. We are actively\ncollaborating with the Defenders of the Fatherland Foundation, and we are\nscheduled to conduct our sixth joint videoconference soon, which is anticipated\nto attract approximately 800 participants.\n\nFurthermore,\nwe have reinforced the coordinating function of public legal offices and formalised the operations of legal clinics. Presently, public law offices have\nbeen established and are operational in 51 regions. When we last reported to you in May 2021, there were 26 such offices.\n\nIt is\nnoteworthy that in five regions, including the new regions, public law offices will\nbe established in the near future. Legislation has been enacted in the Donetsk and Lugansk [People's]\nRepublics, as well as in the Kherson Region, with similar legislation\nforthcoming in Zaporozhye. I anticipate that by the end of this year, or perhaps early next year, public law offices will be operational in these new\nregions.\n\n(The Minister further elaborated on the implementation of mobile pro bono legal aid\noffices using vehicles. He projected that by 2025–2026, in collaboration\nwith regional authorities, public law offices would be established in the vast\nmajority of regions, potentially encompassing all regions. Mr Chuychenko also\naddressed the subject of digitalisation, specifically highlighting the development of the Legal Aid information system, currently operational in ten\npilot regions, and the ВПРАВЕ.РФ legal education portal, which features over\n200 real-life scenarios accessible for public consultation. Plans are underway\nto expand this to a thousand scenarios next year, utilising artificial\nintelligence technologies.)\n\nAs of today,\nthe number of pro bono legal assistance cases stands at approximately one\nmillion for 2024. For context, this figure was around 300,000 in 2021.\n\nLooking\nahead, I am confident that upon the system's full implementation, we will be\nable to provide assistance in several million cases, considering the 32 million\ncitizens currently eligible for pro bono legal aid.\n\nThis\nconcludes my report. Thank you for your attention.\n\nVladimir Putin: Thank you.\n\nMr Tsivilev said that this year’s\nPresidential Address to the Federal Assembly served as a starting point for the programme to switch to domestically manufactured, energy-efficient heating\nequipment. In fact, this programme predates the address. It stated in 2023 as part of the Ecology project. We expected the transition to this equipment to have\na certain environmental impact.\n\nMr Kozlov, has his impact materialised?\n\nMinister of Natural Resources and EnvironmentAlexander KozlovKozlov AlexanderMinister of Natural Resources and Environment of the Russian Federation: Mr President, colleagues.\n\nOn the topic of making our heating\nsystems more eco-friendly, natural gas and electricity are the two best\noptions. This is why we have been connecting households still relying on coal\nor wood for heating to gas distribution networks, or connect them to the power\ngrid in 12 cities as part of the Clean Air federal project.\n\nAlmost 80,000 homes in these 12\ncities out of 155,000 private households have already been connected to the natural gas distribution networks or the power grid, and the effort to extend\nour gas pipelines so that we enable more single-family homes to get subsidised gas\nconnections carries on. I would like to thank our colleagues from the Ministry\nof Energy and Gazprom for lending us a helping hand and assisting us in these\nefforts. This paved the way to a decline in emissions from single-family homes\nby about 90 to 100 percent.\n\nLet me use Krasnoyarsk as an example. In June, we started installing solid-fuel boilers there, just as Mr\nTsivilev has said, in locations where we were unable to offer utilities\nconnections. This is also an effective solution for reducing the emissions of benzopyrene\nand particulate matter, i.e., the substances which can cause cancers or cardiovascular diseases.\n\nWithin this four-month period, we\ninstalled over 700 boilers, and there is a plan to upgrade over 1,000 more by 2026. Next year, we will bring the clean air initiative to cities in Khakassia,\nTyva, Buryatia and the Irkutsk Region with our plans covering about 35,000\nhouseholds. All these projects will be carried out for free.\n\n(The President then asked Deputy\nPrime Minister Marat Khusnullin to report on the opening of a new road in Kemerovo – a 50 kilometre bypass road. Mr Khusnullin went on to present several major\nprojects in Kemerovo, including the completed effort to improve a 540-hectare\nterritory in the centre of Kemerovo. This would have been impossible without a major reduction in car traffic in the centre of Kemerovo.)\n\nVladimir Putin:I would like to ask Mr\nStarovoit about the shipment of containers from the Far East, now that we are in Siberia, not far\nfrom the Far East.\n\nWhat is the situation\nlike there? We have discussed this issue actively in summer.\n\nMinister of TransportRoman StarovoitStarovoit RomanMinister of Transport of the Russian Federation:Good afternoon, Mr President. Colleagues,\n\nIndeed, containers with\nimported goods have been accumulating at Far Eastern seaports since mid-2022. As you remember, we faced some serious difficulties at that time. Mr President,\nthanks to your support in late 2022, comprehensive decisions were adopted. Today,\nthey also make it possible to expand the shipment of containers with imported\ngoods and to rationally utilise the throughput capacity of the Eastern\nOperating Domain by reducing empty runs of open wagons.\n\n(The Minister reported\nthat, as of today, 11 trains laden with containers inside open wagons were\ndeparting daily. At the same time, railway transport has delivered 905,000 containers\nmeasuring 20 feet each from the Far East in the past nine months. This exceeds\nsimilar 2023 volumes by 4.5 percent. He noted that, acting in accordance with\nthe President’s instruction, Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Savelyev had\ndiscussed the issue of accumulating containers at Far Eastern seaports in detail\non September 12 at a meeting with Russian Railways representatives and those\nfrom seaport terminals. Following the meeting, the concerned officials were\ninstructed to expand traffic volumes and to organise safe technological\noperation of seaports. Consequently, average daily traffic volumes reached\n3,817 containers in September-October 2024 and exceeded August 2024 levels by 14\npercent.Today, about 49,000 imported containers have accumulated at Far Eastern\nseaport terminals. This is 7,000 containers and 13 percent less on average\ndaily September 2024 volumes.)\n\nI would also like to note that, since April 2024, amendments to the Federal Law on Seaports have\nentered into force. Officials at seaport administrations in the Primorye Territory\nare personally responsible for monitoring the transhipment of freight consignments\nand their technological accumulation at seaport terminals. Additionally, we\nhave approved a procedure for informing the captains of seaports about such\nmonitoring processes.\n\nThe Ministry of Transport oversees the delivery of containers with imported goods from Far\nEastern seaports all the time. We hold regular weekly meetings to address\nurgent issues at our headquarters. I receive daily updates and report them to the Government.\n\nWhile taking into\naccount the fact that the demand for transportation at Far Eastern seaports is\nconstantly growing and realising that, as usual, traffic volumes will peak in November,\nDecember and January, we will continue this work.\n\nThat concludes my report. Thank you.\n\nVladimir Putin:All right.\n\nMr Starovoit, you should\nmonitor the situation, no matter what, because they should not be stockpiled\nthere … You understand and know everything yourself. I hope that you are\ncooperating with all transport services and Russian Railways. We simply have to prevent any overloads. Please be more attentive.\n\nRoman Starovoit:Yes, of course.\n\nVladimir Putin:Mr Chernyshenko, we discussed the issue of promoting the Paralympic movement several times and planned to hold a meeting\nwith our Paralympic athletes.\n\nI know that the National Abilympics Championship for people with\ndisabilities ended yesterday. How did it go?\n\nDeputy Prime MinisterDmitry ChernyshenkoChernyshenko DmitryDeputy Prime Minister of the Government of the Russian Federation:Mr President, it is true that one of the national goals you have formulated is to help every person realise their\npotential and develop their talents.\n\nAs per your instructions, the Government is creating conditions for the personal fulfilment of all our citizens. People with disabilities, with limited\nhealth capacities are one of the most vulnerable groups.\n\nWe launched the Abilympics movement in 2015 in accordance with your\ninstructions. It is part of the Russia – Land of Opportunity presidential\nplatform incorporated into the Professionalitet federal project.\n\nWe have come a long way over the past 10 years. The number of competitions and competencies has grown from 29 to 206. The main competencies\nwe train people in include IT, public catering, services, construction and medical professions. There are winners in each competence who show by example\nthat you can be successful and what people with disabilities can do as professionals.\n\nSince the launch of the Abilympics project, the number of people taking\npart in our competitions has increased tenfold, to 25,000 this year. There are\nveterans of the special military operation among the participants. I would like\nto propose, and hope that you will support our initiative, that a separate\nchampionship for veterans of the special military operation be held next year.\n\nOverall, more than 120,000 people have taken part in our championships.\nThis figure should grow, of course.\n\nIncidentally, championships for the new Russian regions were held in Moscow, and this year the Donetsk and Lugansk people’s republics and the Kherson and Zaporozhye regions have held such championships in their\nterritories.\n\nThese championships are becoming an international venue. This year, we\nhad competitors from eight friendly countries such as China, Belarus and Qatar.\n\nMr President, the final declaration of the BRICS Summit, which you and the heads of the other group’s countries have signed, has a special focus on the development of youth exchanges, notably, in education and the training and advanced training of personnel. We are considering the possibility of holding\nannual BRICS professional skills competitions for people with disabilities, and the Abilympics championship, in which athletes from other countries take part,\nwill promote this cooperation.\n\nAs you said,\nthe awards ceremony for the winners and medalists of the tenth championships took\nplace literally yesterday. It was a round-figure event, and there were 450 winners\nwho received certificates for training and for purchasing rehabilitation tools.\nBut if we speak about the main outcome, it is the fact that 93.5 percent of the participants are now employed.\n\n(Dmitry Chernyshenko\nsaid that the movement involves around 2,500 Russian companies today. There are\nindustries where employers are actively seeking workers with disabilities –\nprimarily, processing industries, trade, education, healthcare and social\nservices. He also noted the industries where more people with disabilities should\nbe employed, which are hospitality, public catering, culture, finance and insurance.)\n\nIn view of the positive experience around this championship, I would like to ask you to instruct\ncompetent ministries, in cooperation with regional officials and their industrial\npartners, to work on a series of measures to boost professional skills among children\nand youth with health restrictions and disabilities, so that they could realise\ntheir potential and find employment.\n\nThank you.\n\nVladimir\nPutin: Thank you.\nThis is very important work. Of course, draft instructions must be developed to this effect.\n\nYou know, I recently met with men who served in the special military operation and returned\nwith a disability, including men who are now confound to wheelchairs. I asked them\nhow they were doing, and they said: “We are great.” “Any problems?” “No problems at all.” But just in case, I asked my colleagues from the Executive Office to speak with each of them and see what their living and working\nconditions were. I believe there are many problems and issues. Some of these men have a job and others can’t even\nget one.\n\n(Speaking to Dmitry Chernyshenko.)I would like to ask you and Ms Golikova to work with the Defence Ministry and develop a list of instructions\nto address this very important matter.\n\nFormally, these\npeople have received everything they were eligible for – but it is not enough. An individual approach is necessary. There is the foundation [Defenders of the Fatherland]\nand other things, but it is important that all this works well in the regions.\nI know that our colleagues are working hard and doing many things. It is not enough.\nFrom what I see, it is not enough.\n\nSo, this is a good idea. It is necessary to develop the instructions you\ntalked about, first of all, and, second of all, this matter is extremely important\nas it is and we must work on it further.\n\nThank you.\n\nMs Lut, please.\n\nMinister of AgricultureOksana LutLut OksanaMinister of Agriculture of the Russian Federation: Mr President, colleagues.\n\nEnsuring sustainable development for rural territories is one of the key tracks as set forth in the Food Security Doctrine.\nWe launched the programme titled Comprehensive Development of Rural Areas in 2020 as per your instructions.\n\nLet me begin by saying that the regions welcomed the tools they received under this state programme. It enabled\nthem to achieve quality infrastructure improvements in rural areas. This is\nwhere 37 million people live today.\n\nOver the past five years, we have managed\nto launch infrastructure projects in almost 12,000 communities, covering 40\npercent of the rural population. By the end of this year, we will have built or upgraded about 5,000 units of social, housing, utilities and transport\ninfrastructure, while also completing over 13,000 territorial improvement projects.\n\nWe created 248 schools, 155\nkindergartens, 66 rural medical posts and first-aid stations, outpatient\nclinics, 338 cultural centres, 1,190 utilities infrastructure units, including\n660 water supply and sewage facilities, and built almost 2,000 kilometres of rural roads – all this was done as part of the track titled A Modern Look for Rural Areas.\n\nThe improvement projects include\nbuilding sports courts, playgrounds, and creating new public spaces, as well as improving street lighting.\n\nOf course, we attach special\nimportance to improving housing conditions for our people. More than 185,000\nfamilies bought new comfortable housing, including by taking out rural\nmortgages, which is our main mechanism in this sector. This effort amounted to about 11,000 square metres over a five-year period.\n\nMost of those who used rural\nmortgages were young people under the age of 40 years, and half of them moved\nfrom cities to rural areas. Moreover, 80 percent of them opted for living in single-family homes instead of apartment blocks. <…>\n\nThe state programme received 263\nbillion rubles from the federal budget in 2020–2024. We can see that the corporate world has demonstrated its unwavering and steady interest in this\nstate programme. Russian companies adhere to their corporate social responsibility\nand seek to take care of their employees living in rural areas. They\nvoluntarily co-finance initiatives under the state programme to develop social\nand utilities infrastructure. Over the reporting period, these businesses\ninvested about 17 billion in this programme from their own funds.\n\nNext year, the programme is expected\nto receive 108 billion rubles from the federal budget as per the corresponding\nlaw, and another 185 billion in 2026 and 2027. This funding will enable us to undertake\nanother 3,000 projects as part of the A Modern Look for Rural Areas\ninitiative.\n\nOn a separate note, commencing in 2025, the Comprehensive Development of Rural Areas\nstate programme will be launched in the four new regions. We have identified\nprojects, and selections have been made. We will work on establishing social\nand engineering infrastructure in these areas.\n\n(The minister emphasised the necessity of synchronising all sectoral programmes that\nare to implement measures in rural areas. These encompass 14 state programmes,\nincluding healthcare, education, culture, physical training, sports, tourism,\nand others. Priority within these programmes will be accorded to support core\nresidential areas, enabling a 30 percent improvement in the quality of their\nenvironment and life by 2030.)\n\nAt present,\nthe agro-industrial sector employs approximately six million individuals, who\nare instrumental in ensuring national food security. It is pertinent to note\nthat even major holdings, offering competitive salaries which have increased by 60 percent over the past eighteen months, are experiencing significant staffing\ndemands. Naturally, this impacts production rates within the industry.\n\nAnother\nobjective is the execution of Technological Support for Food Security, a new\nnational project necessitating leadership in areas such as breeding, plant and animal genetics, production of ferments, food and feed additives, veterinary\nmedicines, agricultural machinery, and equipment for the food industry, all of which, unsurprisingly, require personnel for these sectors.\n\nWe\nrecognise that one of our most crucial tasks is the establishment of a system\nfor the training of agrarian personnel and ensuring the requisite quality of life for them in rural areas. The fundamental component in this endeavour is,\nunmistakably, agrotechnological classes, which must primarily be accessible in rural schools.\n\nAnnually,\nover 50,000 young specialists enter the labour market solely through\neducational institutions under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Agriculture.\nNaturally, we have tasked ourselves with ensuring their employment within our\nindustry and their comfortable residence in rural areas.\n\nMr President,\n\nThe measures planned under the state programme for the comprehensive development of rural areas and the new national project Technological Support for Food\nSecurity will undoubtedly facilitate the attainment of the indicators outlined\nin the Food Security Doctrine and contribute to meeting national objectives and enhancing the living standards of the population, which you have designated as the key priority of our nation's development.\n\nThank you.\n\n(After that, the President gave the floor to Viktor Tomenko, Governor of the Altai Territory, who elaborated on the progress\nof the Comprehensive Development of Rural Areas programme in this large\nagricultural region.)\n\nVladimir Putin: We have had this programme in place since\n2020. We have seen a few achievements, to put modestly. We have indeed\naccomplished something in housing construction and roads, but we all know that\nmuch more needs to be done. Most importantly, we have seen a positive trend, a good proportion of rural population, which is the most essential aspect of rural development. As of January 1, 2024, rural population of the Russian\nFederation accounted for 25.1 percent of the total, while the target share is\n25 percent. This is a generalised indicator that shows that the state programmes\nare generally working, promoting rural economic growth and production, which is\nthe most important thing.\n\nHowever,\nthere is one more point I would like to make. Despite the increase in the funding,\nthe number of projects implemented under the comprehensive rural development\nprogramme is decreasing. It is clear why – because of the rising costs. I do\nnot want to go into details or bore everyone with figures now, but I would ask\nyou to consider this matter.\n\nYou need to prioritise, and you need to collaborate – the Government and the regions – to preclude\ninflated costs of any of the projects being implemented in rural areas without\ngood reason. This is a large and complex work, which must certainly be\ncontinued, and we must do it together. But on the whole, the programme is\nreally making good progress.\n\nThank you. All the best. Thank you.\n\nPublished in sections:News,Transcripts\n\nPublication date:October 30, 2024, 18:00\n\nDirect link:en.kremlin.ru/d/75456\n\nText version"
