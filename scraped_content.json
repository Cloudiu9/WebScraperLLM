        "content": "On the Russian side, the meeting was attended\nby Foreign MinisterSergei LavrovLavrov SergeiMinister of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation, Deputy Chief of Staff of the Presidential\nExecutive Office – Presidential Press SecretaryDmitry PeskovPeskov DmitryDeputy Chief of Staff of the Presidential Executive Office, Presidential Press Secretary, and Presidential\nAideYury UshakovUshakov YuryAide to the President.\n\n* * *\n\nBeginning of Russian-Palestinian talks\n\nPresident of Russia Vladimir Putin:Mr President, friends,\n\nDuring your visit to Moscow in August, we\nengaged in extensive discussions, exchanged views on the situation in the Middle East, reviewed crucial aspects of Russian-Palestinian cooperation, and also concurred that you would attend the BRICS summit in Kazan to continue our\ndialogue.\n\nRegrettably, since our previous meeting, the situation in the region has not improved; on the contrary, it is deteriorating.\nThe tragic events in the Gaza Strip have already led to more than 40,000 deaths\nand provoked tensions in Lebanon and other parts of the Middle East. Tensions\nare also escalating in the West Bank. We all bear witness to this.\n\nRussia's principled position is consistent and absolutely impartial: we firmly advocate for an early cessation of bloodshed\nand the provision of humanitarian access to all those in need. We urge all\nparties to exercise restraint.\n\nA lasting peace in the region can only be\nachieved through a political and diplomatic settlement based on recognised\ninternational legal grounds and platform, which provide for the establishment\nof an independent sovereign Palestinian State that would coexist in peace and security with Israel.\n\nRussia has traditionally devoted special\nattention to the Middle East settlement issue. Among other efforts, we have\nbeen addressing this issue during our BRICS chairmanship. As you observed at the meeting and during bilateral contacts, BRICS countries have similar\napproaches. This was affirmed both by the extraordinary BRICS summit on the Palestinian-Israeli conflict and the discussion that took place here in Kazan.\n\nOf course, Russia cannot overlook the needs of the people. As you are aware, we have transferred over 800 tonnes of supplies,\nincluding food and medicine, to the Palestinians. Naturally, we will do everything\nwithin our power to steer the situation towards the resolution of all the problems in this area.\n\nPresident of the State of PalestineMahmoud AbbasAbbas MahmoudPresident of the State of Palestine(retranslated): Our meeting today and this day itself are of critical importance to us.\n\nThe events held within BRICS under\nyour chairmanship were a success. As you mentioned, we met in August and had\nextensive discussions about Palestine-Russia relations. We are pleased with the strong stance that the Russian Federation has adopted to support the Palestinian cause and the Palestinian people’s sovereign right to achieve their\ngoals, including the establishment of our own state. The Palestinian people highly\nappreciate this, Mr President.\n\nWe were very pleased to hear what\nyou had to say in your remarks, where you addressed all issues that we find\nimportant. A significant portion of what you said covered the Palestinian\nissue, which is of our deep concern, and everyone heard it. During today’s\nsession, you said many important things, and I would like to thank you for that.\n\nThe events and activities of the BRICS Summit have left a strong impression on us. We stand ready to assist you in promoting cooperation within this framework and, God willing, someday we will join\nBRICS as a group member, a partner, or an observer. We are ready to contribute in any capacity.\n\nMr President, you mentioned the ongoing\ndevelopments in the Palestinian territories. It is indeed a tragedy: more than\n40,000 people died, 100,000 were injured, and 10,000 are missing. All of that happened\nin the Gaza Strip. Seventy percent of infrastructure, including organisations,\nhospitals, homes, and buildings, has been destroyed.\n\nWhat do we want? We only seek a cessation of hostilities, something that everyone else is calling for as well.\nWe hope to achieve this, and having done that, we can start bringing in humanitarian aid and increasing its volumes in order to alleviate the suffering\nof civilians. We need to bring in clothing, food, water, and medicine.\n\nThere is another important point\nthat I must address. The Palestinians will never leave Gaza, just as they will\nnever leave the West Bank of the Jordan River. This is crucial. [Israeli Prime\nMinister Benjamin] Netanyahu is trying to do just that, to expel Palestinians\nfrom their native lands, but we will never agree to that.\n\nWe are aware of the fact that both\nEgypt on Gaza’s side and the Jordanians on the West Bank of the Jordan River’s side\ndo not support this policy and denounce it. Gaza is an integral part of the Palestinian state. Therefore, we are determined to work on putting an end to the occupation so that we can live in a united Palestinian state as one with\nGaza and the West Bank.\n\nWe know there was a coup in Gaza in 2007,\nand Hamas came to power. But we have never thought of this part of our country\nas a foreign body.\n\nAlso, Mr President, you have called\nfor a dialogue on the Palestinian issue. We agree with that. Most importantly,\nit should take place within the internationally legitimate framework. We\nsupport this idea. We thank you for your efforts and attention to the Palestinian cause.\n\nMoreover, Mr President, the United\nStates and some Arab countries are making appeals that we find unclear. We\ndisagree with them and see them as interference in our domestic affairs. When I say this, I mean they want to appoint certain individuals to specific\npositions.\n\n<…>\n\nPublished in sections:News,Transcripts\n\nPublication date:October 24, 2024, 20:10\n\nDirect link:en.kremlin.ru/d/75387\n\nText version"

        "content": "President of Russia Vladimir Putin: Mr Goldshtein, I would like to thank you for what\nyou accomplished in the Far East. I can offer you a position in the Komi\nRepublic, where, as I am aware, you started working in 1990 as a driver.\n\nYou gradually moved up to become a member of the State Council of the Republic, and then a State Duma deputy. You\nhave then worked for five years in the Far East.\n\nHow do you feel about returning to Komi?\n\nRostislav Goldshtein: Mr President, it is a great honour and tremendous responsibility for me. Komi is a vast and economically developed republic. Your trust always\ndoubles the amount of responsibility for me, and I am proud and honoured to accept\nyour offer. I am confident we will be able to do our best to move the republic\nforward. I am sure we will succeed.\n\nVladimir Putin:\nMr Goldshtein, you accurately noted that the republic boasts a strong\npotential. I also worked there for a short while as a student construction team\nmember. But I got a sense of the republic’s potential over the past few years.\nWhat do you see as the most promising areas?\n\nRostislav Goldshtein: Mr President, coal mining and bauxite production hold a lot of promise.\nRusal is operating there. Originally, there was a project to build an alumina\nplant for deeper processing, but, unfortunately, it was suspended.\n\nThere are titanium projects, as well\nas a vast Timan-Pechora oil and gas province developed by Lukoil and Rosneft,\namong other companies. Gazprom Transgaz Ukhta and Severgazprom are major gas\ntransit operators on the Yamal–Western Europe pipelines. There is also an extensive deep-processing lumber industry. A Komi entrepreneur bought factories\nfrom IKEA and then took the operations to a whole new level.\n\nNotably, there are a number of longstanding issues in the Komi Republic, such as improving and supporting\nnorthern towns such as Vorkuta, Inta, and Pechora. I would like to ask your\npermission and ask you to issue an instruction for Maxim Oreshkin and me to work\non plans to further develop these territories and to see what we can do. I would\nlike to take three to four months to get up to speed with the things on the ground, and then report back to you and obtain your instruction to address\nthese issues. Solving these issues is a long time coming, so we need to address\nthem properly.\n\nVladimir Putin:\nI urge you to rely on local personnel and to work closely with local\nspecialists. I am sure you will succeed. You have an extensive track record in this regard.\n\nRostislav Goldshtein: Thank you, Mr. President. That is exactly how we will proceed.\n\n<…>\n\nPublished in sections:News,Transcripts\n\nPublication date:November 5, 2024, 19:00\n\nDirect link:en.kremlin.ru/d/75499\n\nText version"

All of you are aware of its\nitems. Does anyone have any comments, suggestions or amendments in this regard?\nNone? Then we shall assume the agenda has been approved. Thank you.\n\nIf you have no objections, I will open the meeting, or rather, continue our work.\n\nWe will review a few current aspects of BRICS\nactivities, primarily in the economic and humanitarian areas, and hear reports\nfrom the heads of relevant BRICS bodies – President of the New Development Bank\nDilma Rousseff, Chairman of the Business Council Sergei Katyrin, Chairman of the Interbank Cooperation Mechanism Igor Shuvalov, and Chairperson of the Women’s Business Alliance Anna Nesterova.\n\nAs we pointed out during ourrestricted-format\nmeeting, global trade and the global economy in general are undergoing\nsubstantial changes. On the positive side, the centre of business activity is\ngradually shifting towards developing markets. A multipolar model is evolving,\nengendering a new wave of growth, primarily in the Global South and East\ncountries, as well as in BRICS countries, of course.\n\nHowever, there is still considerable crisis potential,\nnot only due to rising geopolitical tensions but also because of the continuing\ngrowth of the debt burden in industrialised countries and the expanding\npractice of unilateral sanctions, protectionism and unfair competition. A direct result of this is the fragmentation of international trade and the market of foreign direct investments, especially in developing countries.\n\nThe raw materials prices volatility is high,\nwith individual and corporate revenues declining in many countries due to rising inflation.\n\nThe implementation of the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is stalling, with the least developed countries\nsuffering the most from global economic instability, above all food and energy\ninflation.\n\nAs for the BRICS economies, they generally demonstrate\nsufficient stability, thanks to the responsible macroeconomic, monetary and financial policies of our governments. The majority of our countries expect to report outperforming growth rates. In particular, tentative estimates put\naverage growth in the BRICS economies at 3.8 percent in 2024–2025, while global\nGDP is estimated to increase by 3.2–3.3 percent in the same period.\n\nThe share of BRICS countries in terms of purchasing power parity (PPP) will reach 36.7 percent in 2024, which is larger\nthan the share of the G7 countries, which was 30 percent in 2023 and will only\ngrow slightly in 2024.\n\nIt appears that a trend to retain\nBRICS’ leading positions in the global economy will be consolidated, primarily\ndue to such objective factors as population growth, the accumulation of capital, urbanisation and greater labour productivity, bolstered by technological innovations.\n\nTo fully realise the potential of our growing\neconomies and take advantage of the new wave of global economic growth, our\ncountries need to strengthen cooperation in areas such as technology,\neducation, efficient resource development,\ntrade and logistics, finance and insurance. Additionally, we must significantly\nincrease the scale of investments.\n\nIn this connection, we suggest\nestablishing a new BRICS investment platform that would become a powerful tool\nfor supporting our national economies and provide countries of the Global South\nand East with financial resources.\n\nI would like to note that, this\nyear, BRICS has managed to coordinate multiple initiatives aiming to accomplish\ncritically important common objectives.\n\nFor example, this includes efforts\nto make supply and VAT chains more resilient, to counter protectionism, to expand e-commerce and to establish contacts between special economic zones.\n\nWe believe that launching a special\nmechanism for consultations between BRICS countries on issues related to the World Trade Organisation will help us chart a common position on formulating\nmore equitable rules of the game in the global economy and overhauling the international financial system.\n\nIt is necessary to continue jointly\npromoting well-balanced approaches to issues linked with the global economy’s transition\nto low-emission development models and to counter attempts to use the climate\nagenda to oust rivals from the market. This is particularly true of emerging\nmarkets. The BRICS Contact Group for Climate and Sustainable Development is\nactively addressing these issues. We believe that BRICS’ initiatives on partnership regarding carbon markets and the climate research platform are highly\npromising.\n\nBRICS countries are ramping up interaction\nin an effort to expand barrier-free e-commerce. The dynamic growth of online\nsales has increased the number of commercial disputes that need to be resolved\npromptly and fairly.\n\nRussia’s chairmanship proposed\nsharing information about practices for launching online services to resolve\ne-commerce disputes with an eye towards creating joint framework procedures for pre-trial dispute resolution. I would also like to remind everyone about our\ninitiatives to establish a BRICS Investment Arbitration Centre and to develop a convention on settling investment disputes, which will improve the protection\nof mutual investments.\n\nThe BRICS space is home to over 2,500\nspecial economic areas. We believe it is important to establish direct links\nbetween management teams of these territories with preferential and easy-term regulations\nin order for them to exchange best practices on matters such as building\nlogistics hubs, localising the industrial manufacturing, and creating favourable\nglobal competitive environment for investors.\n\nSeveral BRICS countries are among\nthe world’s largest producers of grains, leguminous crops, and oilseeds. In this regard, we proposed establishing a BRICS Grain Exchange, which would help discover\nfair and predictable prices for products and raw materials, since the latter\nhave a special role to play in ensuring food security.\n\nOnce implemented, this initiative\nwould help protect national markets from adverse external interference,\nspeculation, and attempts to create artificial food shortages. Over time, we\ncould also consider transforming the Grain Exchange into a fully-operational commodity\nexchange.\n\nThe contribution of BRICS countries\nto ensuring global energy security is undeniable. The association includes key energy\nproducers and consumers. The joint energy research platform has been bringing\ngood results as well.\n\nRussia also advocates expanding\ncooperation in subsoil use. In July, the first meeting of the BRICS Geological\nPlatform, which provided a venue for an expanded sharing of experience in mineral\nexploration and mining, took place in Moscow.\n\nWe believe it is quite practicable\nto create a separate BRICS platform for precious metals and diamonds, as this\nmarket is greatly overregulated by trade barriers in circumvention of the universal Kimberley Process Certification Scheme.\n\nThe BRICS Competition Law and Policy Centre has built a positive\ntrack record. We believe that we must continue working on this agenda,\nincluding by launching an interstate platform for promoting fair competition.\n\nIn September, Moscow hosted a meeting of BRICS\nTax Administration Heads and Experts. It was quite a success. Our colleagues\ndiscussed important proposals dealing with creating a website to promote\ncooperation within BRICS on tax-related matters, as well as an online platform\nfor digitising tax services. Russia suggested establishing a permanent\nsecretariat within BRICS on taxes which would operate on a rotational basis.\n\nEfforts to enhance transport connectivity\nbetween our countries deserve special attention, since they offer us additional\nopportunities for expanding and diversifying mutual trade. This year, we\nstarted a dialogue on this topic within BRICS. By establishing subgroups on transport and logistics within the Business Council, we made sure that this\ndialogue continues on a regular basis.\n\nWe are also discussing future projects, such as creating a permanent logistics platform within BRICS, reviewing transport routes,\ncreating an online communications platform for the transport sector, and establishing\na reinsurance pool.\n\nHaving hosted a meeting of healthcare ministers\nin October, we have achieved meaningful progress in promoting BRICS cooperation\nin this sector. This meeting defined our long-term vision for healthcare-related matters.\n\nWe established a nuclear medicine group, which will\npromote cooperation in the production of innovative radiological agents and diagnostics. Held in St Petersburg, the first BRICS forum on nuclear medicine was quite useful in this regard.\n\nWe have launched an integrated early-warning\nsystem for addressing large-scale outbreaks of infectious diseases. Russia has\nalso put forward an initiative to create a BRICS research network on public\nhealth so that we can benefit from each other’s best practices for strengthening\nour national healthcare systems. It is essential that we persist in our efforts\nto develop and expand the Vaccine Centre and the Tuberculosis Research Network\nwithin BRICS.\n\nOn a separate note, I would like to mention the publication of the BRICS medical journal’s first edition, which offers a platform for doctors, researchers and medical students to publish their\ninnovative ideas.\n\nBRICS cooperation in science and technology\nsignificantly contributes to bridging the global digital divide and advancing\nartificial intelligence, alongside other emerging technologies.\n\nI would like to underscore Russia's proposal to establish a BRICS alliance in the realm of artificial intelligence. This\ninitiative aims to regulate artificial intelligence technologies, including\nmeasures to prevent their unlawful use. In Russia, the business community has\nadopted a code of ethics in this area, which could be joined by our BRICS\npartners and other nations.\n\nWe welcome the arrangements on common\napproaches to the formation of a system of scientometric databases, as well as the expansion of cooperation areas and the number of participants in the Network University.\n\nI should also mention the decision to establish\nBRICS Geographer's Day, which will now be celebrated annually on August 18. A scientific expedition to the nature reserves of the Krasnoyarsk Region and the Republic of Khakassia in Russia has already been\nscheduled to coincide with this date.\n\nDuring Russia's chairmanship, we placed special\nemphasis on the development of contacts in the cultural and humanitarian\nsphere. The International Film Festival and the BRICS Cultural Festival were\nsuccessfully held, and the Alliance of Folk Dance and the Association of Film\nSchools were established.\n\nLarge-scale BRICS Sports Games have proved to be a valuable initiative. This year, Kazan hosted the fifth such games across\n27 sports. For the first time, they were organised in an open format, with\nathletes not only from BRICS countries but also from more than 80 other\ncountries participating in the competition. These Games clearly demonstrated\nthat Russia possesses a modern infrastructure base and manpower potential to organise major world-class sporting events. To further develop the BRICS Games,\nwe propose devising a special intergovernmental programme and establishing a coordinating\nauthority to implement projects in the field of physical fitness and sports.\n\nThis year, inter-parliamentary dialogue within\nthe framework of the group has significantly intensified. A new format for meetings of chairpersons of legislative committees on international affairs has\nbeen established.\n\nBroad prospects are emerging for cooperation\namong regions, cities, and municipalities. During the thematic forums held in Moscow, Nizhny Novgorod, and Kazan, discussions were held on the prospects for collaboration in the sphere of sustainable development of municipalities,\nefficient management of the urban economy and infrastructure, and increasing\nthe accessibility of urban services.\n\nColleagues,\n\nI thank you for your attention and invite my colleagues to express their views on the above-mentioned outcomes of the work\non the economic and humanitarian tracks.\n\n<…>\n\nVladimir Putin: Once again, I would like to thank you for your substantive contributions and for this insightful and interested\ndiscussion.\n\nWe had a detailed conversation on setting our\npriorities in terms of forging a stronger strategic partnership within BRICS\nand went on to outline our plans for future cooperation. In fact, we share\nclose or convergent positions on most topical global and regional matters.\n\nIt is essential that all BRICS partners remain committed\nto working closely together to create a more democratic, inclusive and multipolar international system. We have a shared understanding of the fact\nthat together we can undertake the most ambitious and large-scale projects and initiatives.\n\nWe heard interesting reports from the heads of BRICS financial and business structures. As a founding member of the New\nDevelopment Bank, Russia wants it to expand its project activities in all the countries which have the status of NDB shareholders and in the countries of the Global South and East.\n\nWe support the BRICS Business Council’s\nproactive efforts to promote cooperation among our major corporations, as well\nas SMEs in trade, manufacturing, agriculture, energy and transport.\n\nIn addition, we believe in the importance of working together within the BRICS intrabank cooperation mechanism as a way to combine our efforts in supporting economic projects dealing with essential\nsocial matters, undertaking regional development programmes and building\ninfrastructure. Creating incentives for using national currencies in trade and investment remains high on our agenda.\n\nOf course, we all praised the BRICS Women’s Business\nAlliance, created with the purpose of assisting women in promoting business,\nfacilitating contacts and implementing promising projects.\n\nOverall, very good results have been reported for cooperation between BRICS countries this year. Jointly, we have advanced in all\nthree dimensions – politics and security, the economy and finance, and cultural\nand humanitarian contacts. We have laid solid groundwork for the future.\n\nThe final declaration, which has been prepared\nfor our approval, reflects our common views on the global situation, the results of Russia’s BRICS Chairmanship, and the guidelines for our interaction in the long term.\n\nI would like to ask our colleagues once again\nif they have any objections or remarks regarding this declaration. If not, I propose we consider the declaration adopted. I would also like to add that we\nplan to circulate it at the UN as our common document.\n\nIt has already been noted that Brazil will assume\nthe BRICS Chairmanship next January. I am confident that Brazil’s chairmanship\nwill ensure continuity in the work of our group while also supplementing our\ncooperation with interesting new initiatives and ideas. All of us will provide\nall-round assistance to our Brazilian friends.\n\nIn conclusion, I would like to thank you once\nagain for our constructive and fruitful joint work and to declare the expanded\nmeeting of the BRICS Summit closed.\n\nTomorrow, we will hold a BRICS Plus/Outreach\nformat meeting to discuss the current aspects of our group’s interaction with\nmany other Global Majority countries. This evening, I invite you to a reception,\nwhich will also be attended by the delegations that will take part in the joint\nmeeting tomorrow. The time before the reception can be used for bilateral\nmeetings.\n\nI would like to thank you again for our joint work.\nThank you very much.\n\nPublished in section:Transcripts\n\nPublication date:October 23, 2024, 14:50\n\nDirect link:en.kremlin.ru/d/75375\n\nText version"
